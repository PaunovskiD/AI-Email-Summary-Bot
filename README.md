# AI Email Summary Bot

## Description

This mini-project is part of my AI learning journey. The goal is to leverage AI for automatically summarizing QA and project update emails. The project demonstrates how AI can improve productivity within the QA workflow.

## Technologies

* AI Language Model (ChatGPT)
* Python (optional, for automation)
* Prompt engineering

## How it Works

1. Input email text or QA report into the AI prompt.
2. AI generates a short summary with key points.
3. The summary is then used for management updates or team communication.

## Example AI Prompt

**AI Prompt Example for QA Email Summary:**

*Summarize the following QA email into 5 bullet points highlighting:*

* *Test results*
* *Bugs found*
* *Pending tasks*
* *Recommendations*
* *Priority actions*

*Email: Today we completed regression testing on Module X. Found 3 critical bugs and 2 minor issues. Pending test cases on Module Y. Recommendation: prioritize critical bugs and retest tomorrow.*

## Project Goal

* Showcase the practical application of AI in QA.
* Improve efficiency and communication within QA teams.
